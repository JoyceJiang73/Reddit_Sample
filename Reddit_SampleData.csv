But the more I think about it, Trump seems very likely to run again in 2024 either as a Republican again or in his own party if he wanted to start that. If he were to start his own political party, he would essentially be splitting the republican vote almost guaranteeing that democrats win the next election.

If he runs as a Republican, we already know he can't win against Biden and people will come out in huge numbers to vote for him and especially against him. Him running again basically ensures another 4 years of democratic control.

Trump has been a god awful president but he's done a great service to democrats by splitting the republican party. 

If congress votes to remove him, he can't run again in 2024 and they're going to be more likely to be unified and have a stronger chance of winning in 2024 and beyond. 

It'd be smart for Republicans to remove him but I'm honestly hoping they don't, because as long as Trump and people like him are still around, it only further divided the republican party",Liberal,Anyone hoping that Trump isn't removed during his trial?,5.0,0.73

So: we separate competitive sports into men's and women's divisions not because of any locker room privacy issue, but because there are genuine differences in typical strength and reach and weight etc. between men and women. Therefore it is not considered fair for the two to compete directly. 

I am assuming that a trans person under the age of 18 is pre-op and not taking hormones yet. (I may be mistaken here?) Therefore, their physical body at birth still corresponds to the gender division we all agree to have for competitive sports. 

As others have said, in wrestling for example athletes are further divided into weight classes, and this is not an issue. But in something like track, or another sport where there is a clear difference between what a typical male can achieve and what a typical female can achieve, it seems to me that a female who is obligated to wear a male's body until she can legally correct it still has kind of an unfair advantage when competing with females? 

But then again, a post-op trans person will still have pretty much the strength or reach or whatever that goes with their body type independent of their gender.

I have a question for people in the first stage of tertiary education at uni/college (18-22), particularly if you are at a relatively prestigious and liberal leaning one. Without giving too much away, my work means I deal with a lot of students from this age. Now, there is a tendency in political leanings towards a strain of 'liberalism' - honestly what I would describe as judgmental moaner-lisa soft socialism. It's the classic tale of students decked in 'wavy' garms telling the world what they think government policy should be towards the homeless... 

I often give this crowd the benefit of the doubt, mainly because I sympathise with a lot. I agree, for example, the UK Govt should do more for the homeless but within the current budget - though this is another conversation. 

So this generation puts a lot of emphasis on mental health. This is good. I agree with this to a large extent. 

How do you, then, justify the Crucible-like scorn that seems to be thrown upon anyone breaking COVID regulations? Again, I'm no COVID denier. I think that yes the 100-strong raves that the police seem to find every weekend are irresponsible and dangerous. I'm talking about the bullying I've seen happen towards people who were spotted with something like 3 house guests that they were not supposed to have. I'm not saying go to a full blown rave, I'm not saying don't wash your hands or wear a mask. I'm saying why the fuck do you tell people their mental health is the most important thing in the world, but then shut down literally any gathering that is in slightest breach of COVID restrictions? Surely you can see how one helps and feeds the other. And surely you can see that while there are risks, everything in life is a trade off.

And sure, much of this is online and keyboard warriors have always existed. But I feel there is something very very sinister about this - people seem to be robots, trying to programme themselves and others into destruction.

From the article:

&gt;Former President  Donald J. Trump and the Republican Party entered this year having  stockpiled more than $175 million from fund-raising in November and  December based on his false claims of voter fraud, spending only a tiny  fraction on lawyers and bills for his effort to overturn the  presidential election, according to new campaign finance reports filed  on Sunday night.  
&gt;  
&gt;The picture that emerges in the new Federal Election Commission reports is  of Mr. Trump mounting a furious public relations effort to spread the  lie and keep generating money from it, rather than making a sustained  legal push to try to support his conspiracy theories.  
&gt;  
&gt;His  campaign‚Äôs single biggest expense in December was a nearly $5 million  media buy paid to the firm that bought his television advertisements.  His second-largest payment, $4.4 million, was for online advertising.  And the Republican National Committee pocketed millions of dollars in  donations ‚Äî collecting 25 cents for every dollar Mr. Trump raised online  ‚Äî in the final weeks of the year as it spent relatively little on legal  costs.  
&gt;  
&gt;All  told, Mr. Trump‚Äôs campaign spent only $10 million on legal costs ‚Äî  about one-fifth of what it spent on advertising and fund-raising,  according to an analysis of Federal Election Commission filings from  Nov. 4 through the end of the year.  
&gt;  
&gt;During  that period, Mr. Trump‚Äôs conspiracy-fueled accusations that votes had  been miscounted or misappropriated repeatedly fell flat in the courts.  Joseph R. Biden Jr. was elected president by voters on Nov. 3, confirmed  by the Electoral College on Dec. 14 and ratified by Congress on Jan. 6 ‚Äî  the same day that Mr. Trump incited a mob that stormed the Capitol.  
&gt;  
&gt;But  while Mr. Trump‚Äôs efforts to de-legitimize the election did not keep him  in power, they did spur millions in contributions from loyal supporters  and provided both him and the party with an enormous infusion of cash.

I'm just sitting here recalling all the times t\*\*\*\* and republicans endlessly kvetched about Obama making ""millions"" ""during"" his presidency; the facts are that Obama made money off of book deals following his tenure.

t\*\*\*\* actively spent his entire presidency grifting, lying, and destroying anything and anyone that got in the way of his grifting.

Meanwhile, like brain-dead tithers, the cult continues to put money in t\*\*\*\*'s collection plate, thinking they're ""fighting for 'murica.""

&amp;#x200B;

As a democrat it is important to tame my expectations for the next 4 years. I remember how Obama was steamrolled by republicans in his 8 years in office. This is because republicans uphold the United States as a dominating world power and will continue to do so. Kennedy was assassinated for trying to make the United States more compliant on the world stage. Those in power want to preserve their control not because they are smarter and know how to move forward, but because that is what an aristocracy only knows how to do. So they hammered the naive idealistic Obama for 8 years, and I expect the same for the next 4 Biden years. 

And the stage is already set: High unemployment, mutating virus, overpriced markets. The market will crash, there will be more virus infections, and more people will become unemployed. Biden will pass a stimulus just like Obama did and... republicans will come out opposing high spending which... will incite a tea party 2.0. No doubt you will see more people protesting in washington. Do I sound too pessimistic? 

Just before leaving the Trump administration cut off Fed emergency lending programs that have helped the economy rebound from March 2020 possibly sabotaging a current weak economy from future help. What more can I say? Also, I wouldn't be surprised if mass shootings make the news again, because you need angry gun loving folks voting in 2024 to keep the democrats from taking their guns.

Now I am not F\*\*\*\*\*\* excusing the neo-liberals here as well.  Look at the absolute sham that is going on at CNBC right now.  It is just as bad as Fox News.  Tell me it isn't.   Please can one neo-liberal tell me how you can defend the actions of these hedge funds who use shorting strategies to destroy companies, thereby making countless people lose their jobs?  

I honestly think these classifications of our political identities are too broad.  Economically, I am a heterodox interventionist liberal, meaning I am all for the free market, but there needs to be some oversight.  Socially, I believe in equality in every regard: race, religion, sexual orientation, whatever.  

What this movement that WSB has started is something I thought I'd never see.  It has given me hope to such a degree that the power of the internet in banding communities together to fight back against institutionalized corruption.  What we are witnessing here is the very fight for our future and for the first time we are WINNING.  The internet has finally been able to organize all its autists and retards into one united voice. 

Back when Jimmy Carter won the Presidency in 1977, the Democrats controlled the White House and both houses of Congress.  Big businesses were so scared that they created something called the Big Business Roundtable.  The prospects of a completely liberal government scared the piss out of them and they pulled in the resources to combat it.  They won.  They managed to neutralize most of what the progressives were trying to accomplish thus creating this lobbyist-infested swamp of a political system we see now in America. **THE POWER OF ORGANIZATION IS KEY TO MAKING INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE.**

What we are witnessing right now is the little guys, the ""peasants"" that were looked down on by the wealthy finally organizing using the INTERNET.  It is my hope that what the autists at WallStreetBets started will light the tinder-box for us to come together and say NO YOU CAN'T F\*\*\*\*\*\* KEEP F\*\*\*\*\*\* US.  **THE POWER OF ORGANIZATION IS KEY AND WE CAN USE THE INTERNET TO BRING MEANINGFUL CHANGE IN A SOCIETY THAT IS SPIRALING DOWN INTO IMMORALITY.**  

Now I know they're going to say market manipulation this, market manipulation that, but these F\*\*\*\*\* hedge funds have been organizing and devising markets to completely ruin for decades.  They don't want us ""lowlies"" to have access to what they have achieved by working with one another.

In conclusion, all I have to say is this: it's not about the money, it's about the message.  DIAMOND F\*\*\*\*\*\* HANDS",Liberal,"With what is going on in with GameStop and Wall Street, don't forget that in 2018 the Trump Administration tried to gut the Dodd-Frank Act",5.0,0.78
